/**
 * Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * <p>
 * S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * T = "ABC"
 * Minimum window is "BANC".
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * {
 * A = 1
 * B = 1
 * C = 1
 * }
 *
 * This is a kind of a sliding window problem. We can use a Fast/Slow. You want to grow your window until you have a window
 * that contains all the characters you're looking for.
 *
 * It will also have a slow pointer that shrinks the window. Once you find a valid window with a fast pointer, you want to
 * starting sliding the slow pointer up until you no longer have a valid window.
 *
 * Once you have a substring that contains all the characters that you are looking for then you want to start shrinking
 * it by moving the slow pointer up until you no longer have a valid substring.
 *
 * so what we need:
 *
 * 1) A result tuple (or two-element array) that represents the start and end index of the shortest substring that
 * contains all the characters. Initialized to the largest possible range. [-Infinity,Infinity]
 *
 * 2) A hashMap to keep track of how letters in the set you've seen in the current window intitialized with all the characters
 * in the set as keys, and all the values as 0.
 *
 * 3) A counter to keep track of any time we see a new letter from teh set when we grow the window, or lose a letter from
 * the set when we shrink the window. Initialized to the number of characters we are looking for
 *
 * 4) A fast and slow pointer both initalized to 0.
 *
 * Then we loop where the fast pointer increments every round. Within that for loop, if we see a character from the hashMap,
 * we increment its value in the map.
 *
 * if its value was a 0 in the hashMap before, then we decrement the number of characters missing, but we have repeats of the
 * character we're searching for we don't decrement the counter
 *
 * Once you've seen all the characters you're looking for, that counter will reach 0 and then we hae a while loop within the
 * for loop that only runs while the number of the counter is 0.
 *
 * within that while loop, if the difference between our fast and slow pointer is less than the difference between what is stored
 * in our result tuple, then we can replace that tuple with a new smallest window. By default, the first time we find a valid
 * window, it will update.
