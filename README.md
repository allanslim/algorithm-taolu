Algorithm Taolu
================

In Chinese, taolu (Chinese: 套路; pinyin: tàolù) means "form". The word Taolu is commonly use in martial arts. Taolu is a 
of series predetermined movement combined so they can be practiced as continuous set of movements.

Algorithm taolu is a project, where I practice solving computer science problems. This is my Kung fu. 

```
"Kung Fu means supreme skill from hard work. A great poet has reached Kung Fu, The painter, the calligrapher, they can be said to have Kung Fu. Even the cook, the one who sweeps steps, or a masterful servant, can have Kung Fu. Practice. Preparation. Endless repetition. Until your mind is weary, and your bones ache. Until you're too tired to sweat. Too wasted to breathe. That is the way, the only way one acquires Kung Fu."
